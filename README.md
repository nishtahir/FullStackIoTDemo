Full stack IoT demo
===================

A small project aimed at demonstrating Client, Server and Embedded device interaction. While some scripts were put together with a Unix environment in mind (Tested on Ubuntu 15). The vast majority of the code should be platform independent.

Dependencies
============
* JavaSE 8 JDK
```sh
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
```
* Groovy 2.4
```sh
sudo apt-get install groovy
```
* Expect
```sh
sudo apt-get install expect
```
* MSP430 tools
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install binutils-msp430 gcc-msp430 msp430-libc mspdebug
```

* (Optional) Gradle 2.7

Server
======

## Setup

All dependencies for the front end can be resolved using `bower`. A local installation
of `npm` and `bower` can be downloaded using the relevant task in the build script.

```sh
./gradlew bowerInstall
```

While building, dependencies can be copied into the project using

```sh
./gradlew bowerSync
```

## Package

To package the application for deployment, it's important to package the application along with it's dependencies. This includes the resources needed in order to serve the front end as as other dependencies that may be required.

```sh
./gradlew bowerSync shadowJar
```

## Deploy

The Embedded Jetty Server typically runs on port 4567 however the `-p` switch is used to specify
a port for the application.

```sh
java -jar ./build/libs/HolidayHacking-Server-all.jar -p [port number]
```

Client
======

Launch the client using the command
```sh
./gradlew Client:run
```

Hardware
========
* At least 1 computer
* MSP430 Launchpad

## Program

This task automates programming using `expect`. By default, `main.c` is compiled and programmed on to the device
```sh
./gradlew program
```
